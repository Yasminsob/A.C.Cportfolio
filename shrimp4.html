    <h2>Oven-Baked Shrimp</h2>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound large shrimp</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>Salt + pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley or basil, to garnish</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Instructions:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400F.</li>
    <li>Place all ingredients into a large baking dish, except for the garnish (parsley/basil). Generously season with salt and pepper, then toss everything together until shrimp is well coated in oil and seasonings.</li>
    <li>Arrange shrimp in a single layer, then place baking dish in the middle rack of your oven.</li>
    <li>Allow shrimp to cook for about 8-10 minutes. There's no need to flip them! The shrimp should be opaque and just cooked through, but you don't want them overdone or rubbery.</li>
    <li>Remove baking dish from oven, then garnish with chopped parsley or basil.</li>
</ol>
